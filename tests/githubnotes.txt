git push origin [branch name] => it will push to the github repos which have been saved in the local git.
git pull --rebase origin main => it will pull the files pathway from the github repos to the local git.
git push => now we are push the local to the github repos
$ git push -u origin [branch name] => it will push if the git bash shows upstream.

upstream => it will save the connects of the repos like where we are going to do push or pull actions[for eg: manage passwords present in the any browser].

git branch => for checking the branch 
git branch -d [branch name] => deleting the branch locally.
